# Information Security
Information security protects sensitive information from unauthorized access, use, modification, or destruction. It involves measures to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. It includes activities such as access control, encryption, network security, incident response, risk management, and compliance.
# Hacker
A hacker is a person who uses their computer skills to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.
# Hacker Types 
-   White hat hackers are good guys who use their skills to find security problems in systems and make them better.
-   Black hat hackers are bad guys who use their skills to steal data, damage systems, or do other harmful things.
-   Grey hat hackers are somewhere in between and may use their skills to find vulnerabilities, but not for malicious reasons.
-   Script kiddies are inexperienced hackers who use existing tools to do attacks.
-   Hacktivists are hackers who try to make a political or social point by hacking.
-   Insider threat hackers have authorized access to systems and use that access to do bad things, like steal or manipulate information.
# Root and Administrator
In information security, root and administrator refer to the highest level of access to a computer system or network. The root account is used in Unix-based systems, while the Administrator account is used in Windows-based systems. These accounts have the ability to perform any action on the system, including modifying or deleting files.
# Security Through Obscurity "STO"
STO means relying on keeping information secret to protect a system. It's not considered reliable because attackers can often still find and use the information.
# Vulnerability
A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, software, or network that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or perform other malicious activities.
# Exploit 
An exploit is a piece of software or code that takes advantage of a vulnerability in a system or network to carry out a specific attack.
# Attack
Attack is an attempt by an unauthorized person or entity to exploit vulnerabilities in a system or network to gain access, steal data, cause damage, or carry out other malicious activities
# Privilege Escalation
Privilege escalation is the process of gaining higher levels of access or permissions on a system or network than what is authorized. It can happen when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in a system or when a user intentionally or unintentionally gives themselves additional privileges.
# Denial of Service "DoS"
A DoS attack is when an attacker floods a system or network with traffic or requests, causing it to become overwhelmed and unavailable to legitimate users.
# Remote Code Execution "RCE"
RCE is a type of cyber attack where an attacker takes advantage of vulnerabilities in a system to execute code remotely and take control of the system.
# Shellcode 
Shellcode is a piece of code that is used to take control of a computer system by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the system.
# Eavesdropping
Eavesdropping is a technique used by attackers to intercept information, such as emails, instant messages, or phone calls, in order to steal sensitive information or launch further attacks.
# Cryptography Protocols
Cryptography protocols are a set of techniques used to protect sensitive information. They use encryption algorithms to scramble data so that only authorized parties can read it.
# Virtual Private Network "VPN"
A VPN is a tool that allows you to communicate privately and securely over the internet. It uses encryption to protect your data and prevent others from accessing it. VPNs are commonly used for secure remote access, protecting sensitive information, and maintaining privacy.
